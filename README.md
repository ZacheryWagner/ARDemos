# ARDemos

## Overview
A series of demos demonstrating various applications of ARKit

### Demos

#### Face Tracking
Use a Snapchat like tab bar to apply various hand drawn overlays onto a face
* Swipe through the tab bar to swap face texture
* Tap the center button to take a screenshot
* Hold the center button to take a video

#### Object Manipulation
* Tap on a plane to place
* Move around the object by panning with one finger
* Rotate by panning with two fingers
* Reize by pinching
* Change color by tapping the Object

#### Rocket Launch
A demo for learning how to use particles, animations, and more complicated gestures in AR
* Slide down to start the thrusters
* Slide up to launch the rocket

#### 3D Stickers
Experiment to test quickly caluclating an angle of an object in reference to a tracked face and anchoring based on that angle
* Tap the tracked face to place 3D stickers

### Note
There are much better practices for managing models and AR Sessions.  The production code 
this eventually became has a totally refactored architecture.  I do not recommend using this 
as a reference for learning AR.  Proprietary assets have been removed for the privacy of my 
former place of employment.  As a result this will likely not run.
